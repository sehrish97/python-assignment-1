    "Benefits of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved software-development productivity: Object-oriented programming is\n",
    "modular, as it provides separation of duties in object-based program development. It\n",
    "is also extensible, as objects can be extended to include new attributes and\n",
    "behaviors. Objects can also be reused within an across applications. Because of\n",
    "these three factors – modularity, extensibility, and reusability – object-oriented\n",
    "programming provides improved software-development productivity over traditional\n",
    "procedure-based programming techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improved software maintainability: For the reasons mentioned above, objectoriented software is also easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the\n",
    "system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale\n",
    "changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Faster development: Reuse enables faster development. Object-oriented\n",
    "programming languages come with rich libraries of objects, and code developed\n",
    "during projects is also reusable in future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Lower cost of development: The reuse of software also lowers the cost of\n",
    "development. Typically, more effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and\n",
    "design, which lowers the overall cost of development.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Higher-quality software: Faster development of software and lower cost of\n",
    "development allows more time and resources to be used in the verification of the\n",
    "software. Although quality is dependent upon the experience of the teams, objectoriented programming tends to result in higher-quality software.\n"
